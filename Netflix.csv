Either no drop shadow or with black background. Its very inconvenient, and changes dont happen real time. Most of the time after resetting, i still had to restart my device and play a different flick for it to take effect but sadly this only helps 2/5 attempts. This is a glitch and this needs to be resolved by the developer.",1

They also provide hundreds of recent & older movies. If you want a specific movie just go to search, chances are it's available from G rated to MA (usually NC17). Although movies & series from overseas are generally more racey than prudish American shows. I can highly recommend this service. It's well worth the cost. Peace...",5

Specifically they got to improve: - ability to maintain multiple movie lists (any serious movie watcher has many) - configuribility: user should be able to choose when the UI jumps to the next movie, if at all - ability to create playlists - more fine grained rating Disclaimer: I mostly use the TV/Web interface.",2

df5bfa4e-8922-4d6e-8d20-73eb5b1f5b36,Why Netflix does not understand that in India there are 70% of population who don't understand English(Number might vary). When you mix up the Hindi series/movies with English language(talking about adding 30% English in Hindi series/movies) in between they break the whole rhythm for the ones who don't understand English language. And because of that even the great work by Netflix can be undermine.,2

Go to your profile and choose subtitle appearance. After that you need to clean the app cache so it'll work on your mobile app version. This is really tricky. Why don't just put the subtitle setting on the app version too?,4

6245a0bf-c1d4-493a-9e07-ff04b81dc78b,Wow September 3 went by so fast Netflix made a lot of people mad by taking down the vampire diaries not to mention the missing seasons of criminal minds. I am one of those people who are devastated at the loss of a comfort show I've been watching since I was 7. And in my opinion the supernatural show the vampire diaries is 100 times better than strange things. As I said alot of people are mad at you guys for taking away our comfort show,3

Example julie and the phantoms. You just cancel there season 2 without trying. That's why I will never understand why you make the first season in the first place. Put there hopes up and feel like they have a future. That's messed up. So many levels. I'm saying all the tv shows and movies.,3

Also you can provide some contents free of cost. 3. You can also give categarised subscription. Because people watch only some contents in some languages.

Then my night took a bad turn. The movie paused and the evil never-ending loading circle appeared. I froze in complete shock and horror as I knew that my favorite part was about to appear. I mentally shat myself. Nothing worse could have possibly happened. Thanks a lot for ruining what started to be an amazing night Netflix. 0/5 stars >:(. Weak.,1

I watch movies to be entertained and get away from The Real World that stresses me out. That's why I love Netflix and I love their original movies because it keeps me entertained when others just want to annoy me with worldly content!,5

There's so much content in general to watch and people have busy lives, sometimes it takes a while to get hooked on a show. Not everyone will tune in when a show drops. You gotta let people hear the reviews and find the time to watch it. That being said, I'm impressed at the quality of animation Netflix has produced, such as Trese and MOTU Revelation.",4

Very very frustrating to watch non english shows when the white subtitles completely blend into bright scenes and become unreadable. Ridiculous that there is such an accessibility issue when every other streaming service offers the option to change subtitles. *EDIT I found the setting after having to google it. you should not habe to hunt for settings. why is it not just in the acct settings? not user friendly,3

Keep longmire, the ranch, breaking bad, better call sal, stranger things, umbrella academy And MANY OTHERS. Let the CONSUMERS CHOOSE.. Netflix should create a voting system from the consumers on which shows should stay and go. No matter how old they are, some of us come back to Netflix to watch again. I enjoy watching shows multiple times. I use Netflix to fall asleep. Thank you",4

fd40e7bc-21fc-44af-aa34-fc883f1591a4,"Edit 2022-08-26: Netflix has really gone downhill on some things. Stop randomizing ""my list"". Just leave things in the order I added them! Tons of descriptions now only mention people involved in production, not what the show/film is about. The indicator for new ""short laughs"" is annoying; I don't care about those clips or Netflix games — they're just cluttering up the page. Netflix still wins in content diversity but Disney+ has long beaten them in terms of overall user experience/UI details.",3

The formula was unlimited movies a month for a monthly fee of renting 3 titles at a Blockbuster. Netflix had no physical stores. You would go online pick 3 movies and theyd ship the movies. Return them and order another three. Today we dont say Blockbuster night when we wanna get aovie going. Now its, ""Hey, Netflix and a pizza tonight?"". Amazing!",5

404bbc0f-054b-49bd-bf18-f9cb25788400,Since the price hike I've just been pirating Netflixs stuff. They say its because they added thier games to Netflix but they just glorified mobile games. Why would or should I have to pay for a service I won't use. You could separate the games and films/series and have an ultimate deal similar to Microsofts gold and gamepass. But no one would buy thier 8-bit sh¡t. Netflix made blockbust fall and now its doing it to its self.,2

I like that you can choose basic, standard or premuium The thing i don't like is that sometimes the app strokes and doesn't save my watching history and when i locked my profile i didn't like it so i canceled the lock and i still had to unlock it on other devices. And i don't like that you remove the best movies and shows instead of something that nobody watches. Overall the app is great entertainment!",4
