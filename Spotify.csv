Example being the scroll bar is gone on this recent update, and this always happens. It usually comes back next update and then it's gone again after. There's features that should be here but they're not, like being able to just slide up and down the now playing bar to see your music. I hope this app gets better, because as of late...yikes.",3

To the point where your almost always asked to watch an ad to listen to anything or after every other song. And if you decline it just gets shoved in two songs later. I don't have a problem with most ads but the problem is that they're becoming considerably more frequent, longer and repetitive.

If you temporarily have no signal it will spend minutes searching for songs to then tell you they can't be reached. Downloading these songs won't change a thing, it will still be slow or not work.

To the new releases do not update for days. No ""clear queue ""?!!!! Partially fixed, still dealing with consequences of WORST UPDATE ON ANY APP EVER! EVERYTHING IS NOT WORKING. The only good thing about spotify is FREE SPEECH stand. Radio algorithm just keeps giving you songs you already have in your playlists",4

fd313e69-2df2-41a4-a459-87e9f595228a,GARBAGE entry time an ad comes on it stops playing and won't continue playing without manually hitting play so that makes the ads 50 times worse. Is this a ploy to get people to pay? I won't be extorted and instead maybe I'll start bitching at your advertisers and your advertising service to level that playing field. PANDORA ROCKS!,1

54607dfb-b306-4df3-add1-d9d15457826c,"Used to be my favorite app but lately it has been awful. When i open another app then it stops playing in the background and the song radios are awful. Whenever i go to a radio the music isnt similar at all. I have the same issue with the enhance/recommendation features. Don't get me started on blends, half the time neither person even listens to some of the music or its a song that I havent listended to since I first got spotify. Will be searching for a new music player unless changes are made.",1
9e7f7588-e9e6-4b9b-949d-f3c39b0af2c1,Won't let you pick a specific song and says that after this ad you'll get 30 minutes of ad free music then 5 minutes later another ad and at this point it's only purpose is for listening to podcasts in the back ground. This just in a song that I have never heard of suddenly showed in the notifications area after not having opened Spotify in weeks,2

7ab0a4f7-0a95-44dd-acab-b4c4ad37861b,Worst music app In existence. Only use it because my rivian only supports Spotify. I'm on premium Spotify and the music pauses every 45 seconds to 6 minutes it'll do this for the first 10 songs before it realizes that I'm only playing the music on one device I've gone through and checked and no other devices are playing.

In areas of poor reception Spotify continually fails to show downloaded songs (or takes over two minutes to load) and requests to connect to internet (what's the point in downloading songs if Spotify doesn't show them). 2. Why is Spotify always downloading songs? Literally every time I open the app it downloads 50+ songs despite me now adding any new ones,1

0d6c1464-0245-453c-9825-46be67662099,So I listened to this music for so long but there are so many things wrong with this app one being how it doesn't let you play a specific song you want if the song you want has already played you can't listen to it again and it would only play a little bit before it continues with ur Playlist even though you don't wanna listen to the song that's playing,1

What a joke how could you simply replace an encyclopedia of knowledge with looping pictures. Hell I've been paying so long you should give me a free membership. Just look at how much I use spotify and companies usually improve their platform's not retard them.,5

If the navigation voice plays at the same time as music, it gets delayed more and more until it just crashes.. is there going to be a fix for this already? Spotify really needs to work with the google android auto team and figure this out. Not only does it make it unuseable, it crashes the users phone and infotainment on extended use, which is extremely dangerous on the road....",1

You should have it so we can use are skip song the 6 per hour ones for adds to also let us move the thing of the song so we can move it back to hear that part again. I'm 13 I don't have a job and don't get an allowance so I can't afford Spotify premium. But I am sure it is great. Please consider my feedback to update Spotify. Thank you for your time.,3

3ca8b26b-91ef-4b35-8fb1-884d03803d68,"This app sucks. It alters your playlists without asking unless you have enough songs on your playlist, and even then it sometimes just deletes them. It gives you ""thirty minutes of add free music"" that lasts sometimes roughly 15 if you're lucky, and if you don't skip a single track or change stations, and it only has a fraction of the music you can listen to on YouTube. And I'm not defending YouTube, it's ads or it's practices. Just annoyed by money hungry radio/video services.",1

Hard to find songs because using search you have to listen to the album it's in on shuffle so you may be forced to listen to the entire album before getting to the song you wanted(you can't skip many songs you have to listen). Also can't: listen to suggested songs before adding them to playlists, skip songs in your playlists, change order of songs(even with premium), turn off shuffle. No option to save using 3 months free premium for later. And premium isn't worth the $.",1

Silly things like limiting the number of skips per hour, promising ""30 minutes of commercial free listening"" only to hit another commercial just because I closed and reopened the app. Surely you guys are keeping track of all this data on your end.

Where it messes me up is that my MSI computer plays spotify completly fine, but the chromebook (googleplay version maybe?) is just awful. For one you can't use any other audio exept spotify and can't control the volume. They also changed the interface to be a whole lot less, and just makes it more clunky, confusing, and frusrating.",3

02bcddf8-a43b-47c6-bd33-ee05c791a4d5,"(Premium subscriber) Seriously, what is taking so long to roll out high bit-rate audio. The size of the music library is currently the strongest feature. Generally, creating and editing and sorting your own playlists is still a bit of a chore, but it's good enough. Song queue could be a bit more feature-rich or easier to manipulate but is also good enough. Some of Spotify's genre playlists are fine. The jazz playlists are pretty basic with a lot of fake bands in some of them.",4

You can't choose a specific song to play, you can't choose exactly what songs you do and dont have in your playlist, you can only skip SIX SONGS PER HOUR (unless of course, you PAY) if you skip a song, you can't go to the previous song, you can't see the next song, there are heaps of adds, and it's just SO ANNOYING OVERALL!! Maybe I would give it 3 stars if it at least let me play the full song, not just a preview!!",3

8d63b322-fd21-4259-b6d4-43bc1a8ef3ea,The iPhone version of Spotify has swipe features that should be available on Android but for some reason they aren't. Why should I have to buy an iPhone if I want to swipe to like a song? Why do I have to push the back button instead of swiping to navigate? Hearts show in less places too. Is Apple paying Spotify to make a bad app on Android? Used chrome cast to play music on my TV. Disconnected the app but Spotify would not play music again until I uninstalled and reinstalled it.,1

e7226059-976c-4e25-9adc-e3d3126b1e45,I love Spotify...but recently my account got hacked and it got logged in Indonesia... Spotify just allows users to change the password to protect the account which is not very useful these days....so I suggest Spotify team to bring two factor authentication ( 2FA )....which helps the users alot,1

fab4e6f5-a7d1-4b1b-bb6d-fcc1eff51ab2,"Spotify on mobile is horrible. Unless you have Spotify premium, it is really hard to enjoy it. Ads are so much more frequent on mobile than the web player. Also, if there is one specific song you want to listen too, you might as well just use YouTube because if you search the song you want and try to play it, it is shuffled with 30 other ""suggested songs"" and you have to waste every skip you have trying to get the song you want and you can't play a specific song directly from you own playlists b",1
